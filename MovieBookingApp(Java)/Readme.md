Project Description:

The Movie Booking Application is a collaborative Java project designed to provide users with a seamless and hassle-free experience for booking movie tickets and accessing their ticket details. The application streamlines the movie booking process, guiding users through each step from selecting their preferred movie to confirming their payment and verifying their booking details.

Key Features:

User Registration: Users begin by entering their phone number, which generates a unique token to facilitate their booking process.

Movie Selection: With the generated token, users can browse and select the movie they wish to watch, specifying details such as the city, cinema, date, and time.

Seat Selection: Users are presented with a seating layout where they can choose their preferred seats for the selected movie screening.

Confirmation: After selecting their seats, users confirm their choices before proceeding to the payment stage.

Payment Options: Various payment methods are available for users to choose from, ensuring flexibility and convenience.

Verification: Upon successful payment, users are prompted to enter their phone number again for verification purposes, ensuring the security of their booking.

Ticket Details: Finally, the application displays the ticket details, including movie information, cinema location, selected seat numbers, and payment confirmation, providing users with all the necessary information for their movie-going experience.
