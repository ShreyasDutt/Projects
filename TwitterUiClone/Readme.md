Twitter UI Clone (HTML & CSS)

Project Description:

The Twitter UI Clone is a project I developed using only HTML and CSS to replicate the user interface of the popular social media platform, Twitter. This project demonstrates my proficiency in frontend web development and showcases my ability to recreate complex UI designs with precision and attention to detail.

Key Features:

Authentic Design: The clone faithfully replicates the layout and design elements of the Twitter interface, including the navigation bar, timeline, tweet cards, profile section, and trending topics sidebar.

Interactive Elements: Interactive features such as buttons, hover effects, and transition animations are implemented to mimic the behavior of the original Twitter interface, enhancing the user experience and engagement.

Custom Styling: Custom CSS styles are applied to achieve the distinctive look and feel of Twitter, including color schemes, typography, spacing, and iconography.
