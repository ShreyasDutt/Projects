About 2048 Game

2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game where the player combines tiles with matching numbers to reach the elusive tile with the number 2048. The game is played on a 4x4 grid, and the player can move tiles in four directions: up, down, left, and right. With each move, a new tile randomly appears on the board with a value of either 2 or 4. The game ends when there are no more legal moves.

How to Play

Use the arrow keys or WASD keys to move the tiles in the desired direction.
Tiles with the same number merge into a single tile with a value equal to their sum.
Continue merging tiles to create larger numbers.
The game ends when there are no more legal moves available.
