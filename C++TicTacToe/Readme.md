The Tic Tac Toe CLI (Command Line Interface) game is a C++ project that implements the classic Tic Tac Toe game in a text-based format. Developed as part of learning intermediate programming logic, this project offers an interactive gameplay experience where two players take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid until one player achieves victory or the game ends in a draw.

Features:

Interactive Gameplay: The game allows two players to make moves alternately, selecting positions on the grid to place their respective symbols (X or O).

Clear Display: The program presents a clear and visually appealing display of the Tic Tac Toe board, ensuring players can easily visualize the current state of the game.

Input Validation: Input validation mechanisms are implemented to prevent players from making invalid moves or entering incorrect commands, ensuring fair gameplay.

Win Detection: The game includes algorithms to detect winning moves, accurately determining when a player achieves victory by forming a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their respective symbols.


How to Play:

Player 1 is represented by 'X', and Player 2 is represented by 'O'.
Each player takes turns entering the number corresponding to the position they wish to place their symbol.
The game continues until one player achieves victory or the game ends in a draw.
