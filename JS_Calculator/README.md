This simple calculator project was a hands-on learning experience for me as I delved into JavaScript. Using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the functionality, I created a basic arithmetic calculator. Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with support for decimal input. The calculator also includes features to clear the last entry and calculate the result with the 'Enter' button. Building this project helped me grasp fundamental JavaScript concepts such as event handling, DOM manipulation, and basic arithmetic operations.
